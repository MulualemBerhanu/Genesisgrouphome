Requirements Document for AI-Based Home Care Management System
Project Name: AI-Driven Home Care Management Platform
Client: Genesis Group Home LLC (Oregon-based, supporting individuals with I/DD and mental health disorders)
Objective: Develop an AI-powered website to manage projects, teams, daily client progress notes, activities, and compliance with Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs) and HCBS standards.
 
1. System Overview
The platform will centralize operations for Genesis Group Home LLC, enabling remote management of clients, staff, compliance, and documentation. AI will automate workflows, ensure regulatory adherence, and provide predictive insights to enhance care quality.
 
2. Core Features
2.1 User Roles and Permissions
•	Roles:
o	Administrator: Full system access (manage users, compliance, reports).
o	Care Manager: Oversee client care plans, progress notes, and team coordination.
o	Caregiver: Log daily activities, progress notes, and client interactions.
o	Client (Restricted Access): View personal schedules, activities, and feedback.
o	External Stakeholders: Limited access (e.g., family members, healthcare providers).
•	Permissions:
o	Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure HIPAA compliance.
o	Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Single Sign-On (SSO).
2.2 Client Management
•	Client Profiles:
o	Demographic data, medical history, I/DD diagnosis, care plan, and emergency contacts.
o	AI-driven risk assessment (e.g., behavioral patterns, health trends).
•	Care Plans:
o	AI-generated personalized care plans based on client history and OARs/HCBS guidelines.
o	Progress tracking against goals (e.g., skill development, behavioral milestones).
2.3 Daily Progress Notes & Activity Tracking
•	Digital Progress Notes:
o	Caregivers submit daily logs via forms or voice-to-text (AI transcribes notes).
o	Fields: Client mood, medication adherence, incidents, meals, activities.
o	AI flags anomalies (e.g., missed medications, sudden behavioral changes).
•	Activity Management:
o	Schedule client activities (therapy sessions, social outings, skill-building).
o	AI suggestions for activities based on client preferences and historical data.
o	Calendar integration with reminders for caregivers.
2.4 Document Management
•	Centralized Repository:
o	Secure storage for care plans, compliance documents, incident reports, and training materials.
o	Version control and audit trails for edits.
•	Automated Compliance:
o	AI scans documents for OARs/HCBS compliance and flags discrepancies.
o	Expiry alerts for certifications (e.g., caregiver training, client care plans).
2.5 Team Collaboration & Task Management
•	Task Assignment:
o	Assign tasks (e.g., medication administration, client appointments) with deadlines.
o	AI optimizes task distribution based on caregiver availability and expertise.
•	Communication Tools:
o	In-app messaging, video conferencing, and notifications.
o	AI summarizes key updates for managers.
2.6 Reporting & Analytics
•	Custom Reports:
o	Generate compliance reports (OARs/HCBS), client progress summaries, and staff performance.
o	Export to PDF/Excel.
•	AI-Powered Dashboards:
o	Real-time insights (e.g., client health trends, caregiver workload).
o	Predictive analytics (e.g., risk of incidents, resource allocation).
2.7 Remote Access & Mobility
•	Mobile Responsiveness:
o	Full functionality on iOS/Android (e.g., progress notes, activity logging).
o	Offline mode with sync capability.
•	IoT Integration (Future Phase):
o	Wearables for real-time client health monitoring (e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns).
 
3. Compliance & Security
•	Regulatory Adherence:
o	Prebuilt OARs/HCBS checklists embedded into workflows.
o	Automated audit trails for state inspections.
•	Data Security:
o	HIPAA/GDPR compliance (end-to-end encryption, data anonymization).
o	Regular penetration testing and backups.
 
4. AI Functionality
4.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
•	Analyze progress notes for sentiment (e.g., client mood changes).
•	Auto-tagging of keywords (e.g., "agitation," "non-compliance").
4.2 Machine Learning (ML)
•	Predictive alerts for potential incidents (e.g., client elopement risk).
•	ML models trained on historical data to recommend care plan adjustments.
4.3 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
•	Digitize handwritten notes or legacy documents into searchable formats.
 
5. Third-Party Integrations
•	EHR/EMR Systems: Sync client health data with external providers.
•	Payment Gateways: Billing for services (if applicable).
•	Calendar/Email: Google Workspace, Outlook.
•	API: Open API for future integrations (e.g., state compliance databases).
 
6. Technical Requirements
•	Frontend: React.js (responsive design).
•	Backend: Node.js/Python (Django/Flask).
•	Database: PostgreSQL with HIPAA-compliant hosting (AWS/Azure).
•	AI Stack: TensorFlow/PyTorch, spaCy for NLP, OpenAI API for text generation.
 
7. Deployment & Training
•	Cloud Hosting: AWS EC2/S3 with auto-scaling.
•	CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
•	Training:
o	Webinars and tutorials for caregivers/managers.
o	AI chatbot for in-app support.
 
8. Timeline & Milestones
1.	Phase 1 (3 months): Core features (user management, progress notes).
2.	Phase 2 (2 months): AI integration and compliance automation.
3.	Phase 3 (1 month): Testing, staff training, and deployment.
 
9. Budget Considerations
•	Development: 120k–120k–150k (AI/ML engineers, full-stack developers).
•	Hosting/Maintenance: $2k/month (cloud, security updates).
•	Cost-Saving AI Features: Reduced manual compliance checks and predictive incident prevention.
 
10. Risks & Mitigation
•	Data Privacy Risks: Mitigated via encryption and access controls.
•	Regulatory Changes: Modular design to update compliance rules easily.
